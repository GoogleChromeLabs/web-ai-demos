This repository contains demos related to client-side (in-browser) AI.

## List of demos

Some of these demos use [Chrome built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in). 
Others showcase generic client-side AI using Transformers.js or Google's Gemma model through MediaPipe.

- `weather-ai`: Uses Chrome's built-in Prompt API to generate a human-readable description of the weather from structured weather data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API.

- `right-click-for-superpowers`: Shows how to add utility to a webpage utilizing an LLM (Google's Gemma 2B) to perform common useful tasks like summarisation, translation, or defining words or phrases in a manner that is then easier to understand.
